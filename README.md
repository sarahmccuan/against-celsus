# against-celsus

This repo is for foundational work on a readers edition of Against Celsus. 

Suggestions, contributions and corrections are extremely welcome. 

Work is based on the public domain text critical edition downloaded from [archive.org link](https://archive.org/details/origen-against-celsus-contra-celsum-greek-critical-edition-2-vols-in-1-koetschau/Origen%2C%20Against%20Celsus%20Greek%20critical%20edition%202%20vols%20in%201%20%28Kroetschau%29/). 

There are existing versions available under a CC4 BY-SA license, but this data is licensed CC0 so derivative works don't need to share back.

## Process (proposed)

Note, we're starting with a subset of book 7 & will iterate in relatively small chunks. 

1. OCR text to markdown
2. Correct OCR text as needed
3. Build .tex file to compile into various formats (already successfully tested with pdf and .docx formats)
4. Add vocabulary & notes.
5. Editing? Publishing? etc.
