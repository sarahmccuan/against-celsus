# against-celsus

## Process (proposed)

Note, we're starting with a subset of book 7 & will iterate in relatively small chunks. 

1. OCR text to markdown
2. Correct OCR text as needed
3. Build .tex file to compile into various formats (already successfully tested with pdf and .docx formats)
4. Add vocabulary & notes.
5. Editing? Publishing? etc.
